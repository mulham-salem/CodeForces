# Codeforces Solutions

This repository contains my solutions to **Codeforces problems**.
Each folder is named by the problem number.


- Each folder contains a single solution file (`main.cpp`).
- Only the source code is included — no IDE files, binaries, or object files.
- Language: C++
- Platform: [Codeforces](https://codeforces.com)

## How to Use

- Browse the folders to see solutions.
- Each folder corresponds to a problem number.
- Open `main.cpp` to view the solution code.

## Notes

- Make sure to compile and run the `.cpp` files using your preferred C++ compiler.
- All solutions are personal implementations for practice purposes.
